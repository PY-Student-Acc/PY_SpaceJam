# project 5 temportaty file
# this is a temporary file to hold the code we go over in class for project 5 
# so I can implement it when I finish project 4

# missiles firing out of the spaceship
# they will travel for a bit then disappear
# the missiles won't have collision yet
# that'll be project 6

# this lab has a lot to do with intervals
# this is how we'll make the missiles
# an interval has something keep going without player input

# each missile willbe fired and reach the end of the path
        

# TO DO:
    # make sure missiles disappear after a certain amount of time down their path
    # make sure reload works as well
    # make sure hud is also there
    # upload to github and submit
